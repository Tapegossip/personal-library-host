  excerpt: 'Exploring how connecting different knowledge domains can lead to better investment decisions.',
  content: `
      <p>Knowledge synthesis is the process of combining information from multiple domains to create deeper understanding and insights that wouldn't be possible within a single field. In investing, this approach can be particularly powerful.</p>

      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/great-empires.png" alt="Chart showing the rise and fall of great empires from 1500-2000" class="rounded-lg w-full object-cover" />
        <p class="text-sm text-center text-muted-foreground mt-2">Chart: Relative power of major empires throughout history (1500-2000)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Understanding historical patterns of empire rises and falls, as shown in the chart above, can provide valuable context for long-term geopolitical and economic trends that impact investment decisions.</p>

      <p>Notice how empires follow cyclical patterns - the Spanish and Dutch empires peaked early, while the British empire reached its zenith in the 19th century before declining. The United States showed dramatic growth in the 20th century. These power transitions often coincide with significant economic and investment regime changes.</p>
